# Phone Dialer:

This is a simple HTML5/JQuery object that displays a phone and dials the keypad based on the string passed to the dial function.

# Examples
The JS library allows you to select from an iPhone or Android phone and dial any digits on the keypad by passing 
it a string of either numbers or characters.

You can also specify the phone type you would like the dialing action to happen on by simply passing in the device name.
Also you can build out an array of "demos" to run to customize the phone experience for yourself.

Please feel free to add and expand.
